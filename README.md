## 📖 Description
Welcome to the **pytorch-mobilenet-efficiency** project! This application allows you to explore the efficiency of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It includes implementations of MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 from scratch. This project showcases model compression by applying Knowledge Distillation. You can train a lightweight MobileNetV2 (the student model) using a ResNet-18 (the teacher model). 

## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow the steps below to download and run the software.

### 📋 System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 10 or later, or any Linux distribution
- RAM: At least 4 GB recommended
- Disk Space: Minimum 500 MB free space
- Python: Version 3.6 or later 

### 🛠️ Installation Steps
1. **Visit the Downloads Page**  
   Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Sheaantisocial810/pytorch-mobilenet-efficiency/releases) to find the latest version of the software.

2. **Choose the Right Package**  
   Look for the release that suits your operating system. For Windows, download the `.zip` package. For Linux, use the `.tar.gz` file.

3. **Download the File**  
   Click on the link for the release to initiate the download. Your browser will download the file to your default downloads folder.

4. **Extract the Files**  
   Once the download completes, navigate to your downloads folder. If you downloaded a `.zip` file, right-click on it and select "Extract All". For `.tar.gz`, use an archive manager to extract the contents.

5. **Open the Command Line or Terminal**  
   - For Windows, search for "Command Prompt" in the Start menu.
   - For Linux, open the Terminal application.

6. **Navigate to the Extracted Folder**  
   Use the following command:

   ```bash
   cd path_to_extracted_folder
   ```

   Replace `path_to_extracted_folder` with the actual path where you extracted the files.

7. **Install Required Packages**  
   Install the necessary Python packages. Run this command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

8. **Run the Application**  
   After the installation is complete, you can start the application by executing:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
